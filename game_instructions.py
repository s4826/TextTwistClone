    Welcome to SeanTwist, a TextTwist clone!

    Instructions:
    Given six letters, type as many words as you can
    in the allotted time.

    Controls:
    Use keyboard letters to type words
    Use enter/return to submit a word
        (if nothing happens when 'enter' is pressed, the word is not valid or
            it has already been entered)
    Use backspace to remove a letter from the current typed word
    Use space bar to shuffle the given letters

    Use tab to cycle between buttons and the word entry area. If neither of the
    buttons is highlighted, the focus is on the word entry area.

    Use the start button to start the game initially,
        or to start the next level.

    Use the reset button to completely reset the game.

    Good luck!
