    Welcome to SeanTwist, a TextTwist clone!

    Instructions:
    Given six letters, type as many words as you can
    in the allotted time.

    Controls:
    Use keyboard letters to type words
    Use enter/return to submit a word
        (if nothing happens when 'enter' is pressed, the word is not valid)
    Use backspace to remove a letter from the current typed word
    Use space bar to shuffle the given letters

    Use the start button to start the game initially,
        or to start the next level.

    Use the reset button to completely reset the game.

    Good luck!
